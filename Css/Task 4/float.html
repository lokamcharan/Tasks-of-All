    <b><h2>Virat Kohli</h2></b>

    <p>
      Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November
      1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the
      Indian national cricket team. He plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in
      the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Considered to be one of the best
      cricketers in the world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest
      batsmen in the history of the sport.[4] Nicknamed "The King", due to his
      dominant style of play and popularity, Kohli holds numerous records in his
      career across all formats. In 2020, the International Cricket Council
      named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to
      India's successes, captaining the team from 2014 to 2022, and winning the
      2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy. He is among the only four
      Indian cricketers who have played over 500 matches for India.[5] Born and
      raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and
      started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his
      international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI
      team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the
      number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time.
      During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the
      tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the
      world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to
      hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form
      continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000
      international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to
      step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following
      the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the
      Test team as well.
